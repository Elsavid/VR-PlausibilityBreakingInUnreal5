### Introduction
This is an Unreal5 VR project for COMP6371. Coherence and plausibility as crucial
factors in creating an immersive experience. We wanted to investigate whether the use of context and
immersion elements can balance out non-plausible elements. We implemented a matching/puzzle-type game that allows user to play in three different game scenes of rooms of increasing levels of plausibility.  We believed We wanted to explores the effect of manipulating the bottom-up layer
(perception) on the sense of plausibility. 

### Gameplay mechanics 
Matching/puzzle type gameplay, where the player inserts colored objects into bins of the same color

3 rooms, 3 levels of plausibility

- Room 1: everything works as expected from the real world

- Room 2:  one out of three objects is not affected by gravity, with no context or explanation

- Room 3: Everything is affected by gravity, context is given to explain it

Context: The user will be part of a team involved in cleaning an industrial plant that had an industrial accident, and the objects being sorted are chemical wastes and are toxic/radioactive.
